## What we want the program to do?

### 1. We need to create choices for players and choices for computer then ask the players for inputs.
### 2. Compare their inputs with the choice of the computer.
### 3. Check if the game is won,tied, lost, or ongoing.
### 4. Repeat thess steps until the game has been won or tied.
### 5. Ask if players want to play again.
### 6. And if the players agree restart the game again.
### 7. And if the player say "No" end the game and say thanks for the player.




## Let's break those notes down into steps?
### 1.Importing needed modules for our project.
### 2.Then we will define the main while loop and put the second while loop inside it.
### 3.Declare colors choices as variables and specify colors of the game inside the nested while loop.
### 4.Define the game roles by using the second while loop, If Statements and the random moduleâ€™s randint function to get an integer between one and five.
### 5.Then print the outputs of this big nested loop and the If statements inside this big while loop.
### 6.Show the scores of computer and player after each player turn.
### 7.Use the If statements to ask the player if he want to play again.
### 8.If the player choose "Yes" so restart the game.
### 9.If the player say "No" so end the game and say "thanks for playing".


## Great job and remember, this is a milestone project, so its meant to be challenging so try to learn from it.
