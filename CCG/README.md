# Project 1 - Color Choices Game

It is a simple game that gives practice of using loops and conditional statements.

I recommend trying to build this game using your own logic and only refer after you've tried all the other resources out there.
It is completely alright if your code looks completely different than mine. 

**Do refer the help.md file to futher understand the problem and approach.**
